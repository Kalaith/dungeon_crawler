        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>From battle to battle, warriors' swords suffer wear and tear. Their edges grow dull and eventually, they may break. Armor, too, can be broken from a strong blow. Needless to say, a breastplate hanging in pieces from a character's shoulders doesn't do much to protect them. If your characters' goods are in such a shape, get them to a smith to make the repairs.</p>

            <h2>Blacksmith Services</h2>

            <h3>Talk</h3>
            <p>Having seen the battle-worn pass through their doors, smiths can offer the party a tale or two about combat around the area or an inside tip on the best way to use a weapon. The weapons traders who frequent their establishment also leave behind their news, and the smith might pass the information along to you... if they take a liking to you that is.</p>

            <h3>Have Something Repaired</h3>
            <p>That fine two-handed sword you're carrying - the hilt in one hand, the blade in the other - isn't going to do you or your party much good in combat. To have your sword or armor fixed, select Have Something Repaired.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Repair Process:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select Have Something Repaired</li>
                    <li>You will see a list of the character's items and the cost to repair each</li>
                    <li>Select one, and the smith will quote their fee</li>
                    <li>Choose to accept, haggle, or decline</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Haggle</h3>
            <p>Think the smith is asking too much to put your armor back together? If you do, select haggle, a character to do it, and finally the percentage reduction you're looking for. If the merchant agrees to your offer, they will begin work. Of course, you may enter 0 if you feel they're giving you a good deal to begin with.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Keep in mind that metalwork, like any trade, is not exacting nor does it happen at the speed of light. You may have to leave your weapon, and there is a chance that upon returning you'll find your sword or armor is beyond repair or at least beyond the skills of the smith you're working with.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Next Page and Previous Page</h3>
            <p>If your character is carrying lots of items, Next Page will move you further into their inventory. Previous Page returns you to the previous page.</p>

            <h3>Another Character</h3>
            <p>Sometimes your journey has been so long, your battles so hard, that numerous characters come back with their armor and swords in pieces. Select the Another Character option to bring your characters before the smith one by one.</p>

            <h3>Exit</h3>
            <p>Select Exit to return to the Main Smith options.</p>

            <h3>Leave The Smith</h3>
            <p>When you've finished tending to your swords' wounds, select Leave The Smith to return to the streets of town.</p>

            <h2>Repair Strategy</h2>

            <h3>When To Repair</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Inspections:</strong> Check equipment condition regularly</li>
                <li><strong>After Major Battles:</strong> Repair damage before it worsens</li>
                <li><strong>Before Expeditions:</strong> Ensure all equipment is in good condition before wilderness travel</li>
                <li><strong>Broken Items:</strong> Repair immediately - broken equipment is useless</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Cost Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Use haggle skill to reduce repair costs</li>
                <li>Prioritize repairs for essential equipment first</li>
                <li>Compare prices between different smiths if available</li>
                <li>Consider if replacement might be cheaper than repair for low-quality items</li>
            </ul>
