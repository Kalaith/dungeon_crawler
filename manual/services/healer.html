            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Your magician's astral points are wiped out and your most skilled healer is still trying to shake arrows out of their arm. It's a tough situation to be in. If a character lets a wound go too long, they will likely become infected or diseased. Thankfully, towns throughout the world offer the services of healers who can help your party heal its wounds.</p>

            <h2>Healer Services</h2>

            <h3>Treat Wounds</h3>
            <p>After a vicious battle, your proud but worn characters may have a few wounds that need tending. Selecting Treat Wounds and a character in need, the healer surveys their damage, notes the price, and allows you to accept or reject the proposal. Should you hand over your crowns, the healer begins to work their trade.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Healer quotes a price based on injury severity</li>
                    <li>You can accept or reject the offer</li>
                    <li>Hopefully, if the healer is skilled, they will heal your character</li>
                    <li><strong>Warning:</strong> Certain healers have no medical talent but use the healer banner merely to make money</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Treat Illness</h3>
            <p>Characters may incur numerous maladies. Luckily, skilled healers can offer the proper cure for most any illness. Should one of your characters require such an elixir, select Treat Illness followed by the ill character.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Treatment Process:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select Treat Illness</li>
                    <li>Choose the ill character</li>
                    <li>Healer reviews symptoms and work necessary to cure it</li>
                    <li>Healer quotes a price which you may take or leave</li>
                    <li>If you accept, the mystic begins their handiwork</li>
                    <li>If successful, the fee is collected in full</li>
                    <li>If cure is not successful, the healer will only charge a portion of quoted price</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h3>Neutralize Poison</h3>
            <p>Along with wounds and illnesses, many healers can treat poison and neutralize its devastating effects. Just select this option and the afflicted character, and the healer will suggest a price. If you accept, they begin their work.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> As with illnesses, if the healer is not successful, they will only ask for a portion of the total amount due.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Leave Healer</h3>
            <p>When your characters have been nursed and their ills no longer affect them, select this option to return to the out of doors.</p>

                <li><strong>Disease Symptoms:</strong> Visit immediately upon noticing illness</li>
                <li><strong>Poisoning:</strong> Seek treatment as soon as possible to prevent damage</li>
                <li><strong>Low LP:</strong> When party's healing resources are exhausted</li>
                <li><strong>Party Healer Down:</strong> When your own healer is injured or ill</li>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Not all healers are equally skilled. Some are charlatans with no real medical talent. If a healer repeatedly fails treatments, consider finding another healer in a different town.</p>

                <li>Avoid unnecessary combat when party is weakened</li>
