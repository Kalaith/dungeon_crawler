        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Inns and taverns offer a soothing break for any adventurer. For those traveling throughout the wilderness, the comfort of a soft bed and a prepared meal are worth twice the price of the ducats paid. For others, the relaxed conversation flowing in a town's tavern is welcome change. Some adventurers travel to taverns and inns to collect information, and those enterprising enough may even be able to swindle a few silver crowns from patrons.</p>

            <h2>Inn Options</h2>

            <h3>Talk</h3>
            <p>Like merchants, the innkeepers and bartenders have seen their share of adventurers come and go. Hidden beyond their entrepreneurial spirit is often a blanket of information awaiting inquisitive visitors. Selecting this option, you may get the chance to discuss the local gossip. However, don't forget the barkeep has a business to run and doesn't usually stand around for idle chat.</p>

            <h3>Eat and Drink</h3>
            <p>Your characters may order a meal by selecting this option. The innkeeper will tell you of the daily special along with the price. Should you accept and have the money to pay for it, the meal is served.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> While the stout might be flowing, a word to the wise is "moderation." Alcohol's effects can go beyond medicinal, and too much can leave your characters without their wits. Characters who drink too much can certainly become drunk and may suffer temporary losses to their intelligence and charisma and other typical drunken effects.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Rent a Room</h3>
            <p>Rooms range from your finest noble suites to "the cot in the closet" shacks. Depending on your party's taste and funds, you may select the room of your choice. Room quality varies inn to inn, but in general, the better the room the better the night's sleep (and its restorative effects).</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Room Selection:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Innkeeper shows available suites</li>
                    <li>Higher quality = better restoration</li>
                    <li>Price varies by quality</li>
                    <li>After other bedtime tasks, select Sleep to head to rooms</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Use Talent</h3>
            <p>Depending on the inn or tavern and your characters' abilities, Use Talent offers numerous options from Treat Wounds to Alchemy. Your characters may perform necessary healing and quizzical chemistry before heading off to bed. Once you select a talent, you will be asked to choose a character to work their art.</p>

            <h3>Use Magic</h3>
            <p>Along with spells of the healing variety, magic users may chant their incantations in the comfort of an inn. Selecting this option, you will be asked to choose a character to work the magic, the spell group, and finally the spell.</p>

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>Your eyelids weigh a ton, it's been a long day, and it's time for the party to head to their suites. Just click the Sleep icon to do so. Once you select Sleep, provided you have already booked a room, your party is whisked away and brought to the comfort of their respective rooms.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Party sleeps for as many nights as they have paid for</li>
                    <li>Wake at dawn on the last day of stay</li>
                    <li>Restorative effects reported at end of stay</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Leave</h3>
            <p>Select this option to return to the out of doors.</p>

            <h3>Visit Tavern</h3>
            <p>Should the inn have a tavern as part of the establishment, the Visit Tavern icon will be available. Just select this option to move into the bar.</p>

            <h2>Tavern-Specific Options</h2>

            <p>Whether your party enters a tavern within an inn or a stand-alone saloon, they will have additional choices found nowhere else. Stepping up to the bar, your party has several new options.</p>

            <h3>Use Talent - Tavern Entertainment</h3>
            <p>In addition to treating wounds, taverns offer your characters a chance to show off some of their more enterprising talents. While playing in Novice mode, the best character for the particular talent will highlight in yellow.</p>

            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>

                    </tr>
