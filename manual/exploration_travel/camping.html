            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>As nightfalls around 8:00 PM, your adventurers will make camp for the night automatically. Although they may not be tired, hungry, or otherwise in need of rest, they know well the dangers of traversing the wilderness in the dark. Characters may also "force" a camp at any time mid-route by clicking the right mouse button.</p>

            <h2>Camp Options</h2>

            <h3>Set Guard Duty</h3>
            <p>While your characters sleep, creatures may creep out of the forest. To protect your party from ambushes, rogues, and other creatures of the night, set guard duty before going to sleep. Select a character to stand guard for each of three shifts. Characters with high Danger Sense and Intuition make the best guards, but be certain they get their fair share of sleep too. Characters who stand guard cannot do other activities like hunting.</p>

            <h3>Replenish Stocks</h3>
            <p>As your party travels they may use rations and drain waterskins dry. Whenever characters make camp and you're running low on supplies, try replenishing your stores. Select Replenish Stocks and a character to do the hunting. Generally, characters skilled in nature and perception have the best chance of success. Keep in mind you can captain two expeditions in a night, and each character may hunt only once. If all goes well, food and water will be used immediately or stored for future use. If the attempt fails, you're free to try again with another character.</p>

            <h3>Use Skill</h3>
            <p>Characters can perform various skills: Treat Wounds, Treat Disease, or Treat Poison. Select a skill to perform and, if necessary, a person to perform it on. Depending on skill level, life points may be restored or the poisoned and diseased may be cured.</p>

            <h4>Alchemy</h4>
            <p>Characters wishing to spend time brewing magic or healing potions may use the Alchemy skill. To mix potions, the character must have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An Alchemy set</li>
                <li>All necessary containers</li>
                <li>All necessary herbs</li>
                <li>An appropriate recipe</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A solid skill in Herb Lore and Alchemy helps. When your character mixes their brew, you will know the outcome. If the alchemist puts together a brew that melts the jars it was concocted in, they will fail the attempt, and all ingredients and containers used will be lost.</p>

            <h3>Use Magic</h3>
            <p>Magicians use the quiet of camp to meditate or empower their mighty wands.</p>

            <h4>Meditate</h4>
            <p>Generally reserved for Magicians of either sex, meditation focuses a character's energy on their magic power so dramatically that it drains them physically. They convert life points (LP) to astral points (AP). Other magic using Archetypes who carry at least one dose of thonnys in their packs may meditate as well.</p>

            <h4>Wand Spell</h4>
            <p>Available only to Magicians or Magiciennes, this option allows the magic user to attempt a transfer of some astral points to a magical wand. Taking a lot of time, the transfer of energy also consumes many astral points, but is permanent once charged. Should your character choose to cast a wand spell, regardless of success or failure, they will be unable to perform any magic for the remainder of the camp.</p>

            <h4>Cast Spell</h4>
            <p>During camp, characters may require healing or other spells that may give your party an advantage. To cast a spell, select this option, a magically talented character, the spell group, and the spell itself.</p>

            <h3>Gather Herbs</h3>
            <p>Used in every alchemist's potion, herbs are a source of magical power for the party and are plentiful in forests. Select a character for the search and send them off. While success depends upon the area searched, those skilled in Herb Lore and Perception find herbs more quickly and are generally better at identifying them. When the character returns, you'll be told of their discoveries.</p>

            <h3>Sleep</h3>
            <p>Before opting to Sleep, complete all your other camp business: healing, meditation, setting guard, etc. As your characters sleep, they replenish both astral and life points. Characters awaken at 8:00 AM sharp.</p>
