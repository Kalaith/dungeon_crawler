            <h1>Travel System</h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>It's time to break out the adventuring gear and head for the signpost. As you travel through towns,
                you'll see posts pointing the way to one destination or another. Typically, there are numerous posts in
                a single town, each leading to a different destination. Among all the posts, there are two basic
                differences:</p>

            <h3>Harbours</h3>
            <p>Signposts at the water's edge give you the chance to secure passage aboard ships traveling to various
                locales. Since ships come and go, the destinations found at the seaports change daily. A word with the
                Harbour Master can offer you an expanding look at the harbor's traffic. When you step up to a port's
                signpost, you'll receive the Port Options.</p>

            <h3>Path/Road</h3>
            <p>Signposts at a village's edge note the way of roads and paths to other towns and follow the general
                layout of the world. For example, signposts to the east generally lead to eastern destinations. When you
                opt to travel on foot, you'll enter the Traveling Options.</p>

            <h2>Packing Your Bags</h2>
            <p>Before your characters head out of town, spend a few minutes with them. It may be several hours (maybe
                even several days) before they see a town or a merchant again. Make certain they're prepared for the
                trip:</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Pre-Travel Checklist:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rations and Water:</strong> Check the amount each character carries. Buy more if needed.
                        Pizza places do not deliver to the middle of dangerous territory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hunger and Thirst:</strong> Fill bellies and quench thirst before leaving. Otherwise,
                        you may be forced to stop mid-route when a character complains of hunger pangs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Equipment Condition:</strong> Are all weapons and armor whole? If not, visit a smith to
                        make the necessary repairs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest Status:</strong> Are your characters well rested? If not, catch some shut eye.</li>
                    <li><strong>Health Status:</strong> Should you make a last-minute trip to a healer to treat disease,
                        wounds, or poison?</li>
                    <li><strong>Supplies:</strong> Do you have a good selection of herbs, potions, or other things you
                        might need? Don't ignore adventuring gear.</li>
                    <li><strong>Party Leader:</strong> Put your best character forward. If traveling in wilderness,
                        characters with strong Nature skills are best to lead. Characters traveling by boat benefit from
                        Survival skills.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Leaving Town Via Ship</h2>

            <h3>About Ships</h3>
            <p>Many settlements grew around bodies of water. These waterways allowed for easy passage of goods and
                generally offered settlers fertile land. Harbor towns generally service ships that travel along the
                coast to the next settlement. The vessels travel to sizable cities within a short range of their home
                port. In large cities, there are often many destinations as ships come and go from all areas.</p>

            <h4>Ship Speeds</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smallest ships:</strong> ~30 miles per day</li>
                <li><strong>Large trading ships:</strong> Up to 120 miles per day</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Harbour Options</h3>

            <h4>Book a Passage</h4>
            <p>Select Book a Passage to make your reservations. The system will show you a list of ships at anchor in
                the harbor and their destinations. This list changes as ships depart and new ships come in (see the
                Harbour Master for a complete schedule), so check back if nothing available suits you.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Ship Quality Matters:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Expensive ships:</strong> Generally travel fastest</li>
                    <li><strong>Luxurious ships:</strong> Offer more restful (and healing) trip</li>
                    <li><strong>Small leaky skiffs:</strong> May offer free passage but poor conditions</li>
                    <li><strong>Longships:</strong> Characters expected to man the oars, won't get much rest during
                        voyage</li>
                    <li><strong>When cash is low:</strong> Any old ship will do</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Should you accept the captain's offer, they'll note the departure time before returning to their ship
                with your fare. You may board the ship now or at any time before it leaves port. If you have a few
                hours, you can head into town. However, keep your eye on the time and return before your ship's set to
                leave. The captain will not hesitate to leave without you.</p>

            <h4>Harbour Master's Office</h4>
            <p>For a small gratuity, the Harbour Master has a world of information for the roaming party. They'll gladly
                tell you about all ships leaving the harbor and even those that are expected (within a reasonable time
                frame anyway). For parties traveling to obscure destinations that are serviced rarely, the Harbour
                Master's knowledge is essential.</p>

            <h4>Go On Board</h4>
            <p>If you've booked a passage on a vessel, select Go On Board when you're ready to leave town. After
                selecting this option, you'll spend your time chatting with other shipmates or looking for fish over the
                sides of the ship. Once you board a ship, you are on board until it reaches its final destination and
                have no influence on the ship's course.</p>

            <h4>Leave Harbour</h4>
            <p>If your ship hasn't come in, or if it's not going to be leaving for a while, select Leave Harbour to
                return to town.</p>

            <h2>Heading Out On Foot</h2>

            <p>Dust off the backpack and put on your best leather boots... your characters are out for a bit of that
                heel-to-toe shuffle. Anywhere your party finds a land-locked signpost, this type of adventure is
                available. Just step up to the signpost to discover where the road or path heads. Keep in mind that each
                city typically has more than one signpost, so checking around, you'll find roads to more than one
                destination.</p>

            <h3>Travel Options</h3>

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>Move the pointer to any area on the map and click with the left mouse button. You'll see a description of
                the area, its peoples, and its climate. While your party can't travel to any old location you click on
                (remember, you're heading out on a specific road to a specific place), this feature allows you to see
                the geography and demographics quickly. Reviewing this map can be very useful in planning your routes
                across the world or for the curious adventurer finding out about many towns and cities. However,
                sometimes dirt tracks or wilderness routes will not be so obvious. It may be necessary to check the
                possible destinations by actually investigating a settlement's journey points (signposts) to find these
                hidden routes.</p>

            <h4>Travelling Options</h4>
            <p>Click the right mouse button to show you the paths available from this signpost's road. You will see your
                current location highlighted with a pulsing blue circle, and the targeted destination will be
                highlighted in red. If the destination is okay with your party, select it and you're off. You may also
                select "BACK" to return to the town you're currently in. If you decide to travel, your party's progress
                will be shown on the map and will deposit you safely at your destination... unless your party
                experiences one of the hazards of traveling.</p>
            <h2>Travelling Time & Movement Points</h2>
            <p>Travel is measured in <strong>Movement Points (MP)</strong>. Each day, your party has a pool of MP based
                on their travel mode. Moving across the map consumes these points based on the terrain.</p>
