        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A click of this icon gets you behind the scenes and lets you perform several game functions. Moving to the book screen, you'll see the time and date, a description of your current location, and the following game options.</p>

            <h2>Available Options</h2>

            <h3>Load Game</h3>
            <p>Just like the Temple options, you can load a previously saved game using this option. Just select one from the menu of six saves.</p>

            <h3>Save Game</h3>
            <p>While out on an adventure, it is possible to save your game at nearly any time. Just select this option to do so. You will be presented with your current list of saves. Select one and rename it if you wish.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Caution:</strong> It's better to save your game at a Temple found in nearly every town or city. The game rewards players who brave it from town to town. Those who take the safe approach and save outside of Temples will lose 50 experience points each time.</p>
            </div>

            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Save Location</th>
                        <th>Experience Point Effect</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>At Temple</td>
                        <td>Full experience points retained</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Outside Temple</td>
                        <td>Lose 50 EP per save</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Erase Character</h3>
            <p>Select this option to permanently remove a character from the register. You may only erase characters who are not in the party. Erased characters are gone forever.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This action is permanent and cannot be undone. Make sure the character is not in your active party before attempting to erase.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Examine Map</h3>
            <p>As your characters travel, they will come across numerous informative map fragments. To view them, select this option. The map pieces your party currently possesses are displayed and you are shown where they fit into the overall larger map.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Map Fragments:</h4>
                <ul>

                    <li>Can be examined at any time</li>
                    <li>Pieces fit together to form complete map</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>View Diary</h3>
            <p>Your characters keep a log of their travels. You may view it any time by selecting View Diary. You'll see a listing of their travels by date, month, and location.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Diary Features:</h4>

            <h3>Adjust Performance</h3>
            <p>Adjust Performance allows you to slow down or speed up according to your system's speed. The default setting is 4. Use setting 1 for faster combat; use 10 to slow it down.</p>

            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Setting</th>

                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>10</td>
                        <td>Slowest</td>
                        <td>Older systems, tactical gameplay</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Toggle Sound</h3>
            <p>When you just can't sleep but others can, this allows you to turn sound on and off.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <ul>
                    <li>Instantly mute or unmute all game sounds</li>
                    <li>Useful for playing in quiet environments</li>
                    <li>Setting persists until changed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>End Game</h3>
            <p>When your day in the game world is at an end, select this option to return to the real world. This option does not save your game. Select Save Game to do so.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Always save before ending game, or all unsaved progress will be lost!</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Back To Game</h3>
            <p>When you've finished saving your game, toggling the sound, or otherwise, click the right mouse button to return to your adventure.</p>

            <h2>Best Practices</h2>

            <h3>Saving Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save Often:</strong> Regular saves prevent loss of progress</li>
                <li><strong>Use Multiple Slots:</strong> Keep backup saves in case you want to try different approaches</li>
                <li><strong>Name Saves Descriptively:</strong> Use clear names to track different save points</li>
                <li><strong>Temple Saves:</strong> Wait for temples to avoid EP penalty when possible</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Major Events:</strong> Always save before difficult battles or important decisions</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Diary Usage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Review diary regularly to track quest progress</li>
                <li>Check diary when you forget what you were supposed to do</li>
                <li>Use diary entries to remember NPC names and locations</li>
                <li>Reference diary for chronological understanding of events</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with default setting (4) and adjust as needed</li>
                <li>Lower setting if combat feels too slow</li>
                <li>Raise setting if actions are too fast to follow</li>
                <li>Find the sweet spot for your system and play style</li>
            </ul>
