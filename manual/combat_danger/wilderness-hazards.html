            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>While your party travels from one point to another, it may encounter certain problems. These hazards are part of wilderness adventuring.</p>

            <h2>Common Hazards</h2>

            <h3>Hunger & Thirst</h3>
            <p>The most common problems of adventuring. While on the trail, your characters use energy and naturally need food and water. When characters are hungry or thirsty, the system will let you know. Click the right mouse button to stop progress and camp. If you ignore hunger and thirst, starvation and dehydration are virtually inevitable.</p>

            <h3>Elements</h3>
            <p>When your party travels through snow or scorching heat, the weather affects them and their rate of travel. Crossing through woods in the height of winter dressed in summer gear might cause frostbite, not to mention the extra effort required to traverse snowbanks. Make sure your party is appropriately equipped for the weather. Check characters often to ensure they're not overly exposed to the elements.</p>

            <h3>Terrain</h3>
            <p>Geographic disasters can hit your party at any time. Whether it be a gaping cliff your party failed to discover or a simple step that triggers an avalanche of snow, such events are not uncommon. When your party experiences such an event, there will be a report on the damage. Defend against such happenings by appointing a nature lover to head the party - they're more likely to notice dangers.</p>

            <h2>Positive Encounters</h2>

            <h3>A Good Place To Rest</h3>
            <p>Occasionally, characters will notice a particularly comfortable looking resting place. You may decide to set camp, ending the journey earlier than planned. While the party won't cover maximum distance for the day, they may rest more easily, enjoy more benefits, and awake full of energy. If the game is as good as the tracks hint, they may leave with full bellies and packs.</p>

            <h3>Scouting</h3>
            <p>As your party travels along, the lead character keeps careful watch for interesting features - a trove of herbs, collection of tracks, or perhaps rumors beginning to turn to fact. Should your character notice anything out of the ordinary that might help your party, you will be warned.</p>

            <h2>Travel Options</h2>

            <h3>Forced March</h3>
            <p>Sometimes a tempting camping spot may not be enough to get your party to stop. You know you can reach your destination before nightfall. Right click while travelling and select "Force March" to push your party on. Keep in mind there are no guarantees your party will reach its destination before nightfall or before everyone is exhausted. Camping will then be necessary. Your party, tired from the day's efforts, will likely require more sleep than a simple night's rest can offer, and won't be able to exert extra energy two nights in a row.</p>

            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preparation:</strong> Stock adequate rations and water before wilderness travel</li>
                <li><strong>Weather Gear:</strong> Equip appropriate clothing for season and climate</li>
                <li><strong>Party Leader:</strong> Place nature-skilled character at front</li>
                <li><strong>Regular Stops:</strong> Monitor character status and camp when needed</li>
                <li><strong>Good Campsites:</strong> Consider stopping at advantageous rest spots</li>
            </ul>
