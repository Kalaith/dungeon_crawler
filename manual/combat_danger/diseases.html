        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Characters may incur numerous maladies during their adventures. If a character lets a wound go too long untreated, they will likely become infected or diseased.</p>

            <h2>Contracting Diseases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Untreated Wounds:</strong> Wounds left untreated often lead to infection and disease</li>
                <li><strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong> Exposure to certain environments or creatures</li>
                <li><strong>Combat:</strong> Some enemies can inflict disease through special attacks</li>
                <li><strong>Poor Conditions:</strong> Lack of food, water, or rest can weaken constitution</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Checking Disease Status</h2>
            <p>While reviewing your character, if they are ill, the "Sickness" option will appear on the menu. After selecting it, you will receive information about the character's condition.</p>

            <h2>Treatment Options</h2>

            <h3>Treat Disease Skill</h3>
            <p>A character with the Treat Disease skill (CR/WD/CH) can attempt to cure illnesses. Several team members should be proficient with this healing skill.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use during camp or character review</li>
                <li>Select character with skill</li>
                <li>Choose patient to treat</li>
                <li>Success depends on skill level</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Healer Services</h3>
            <p>Towns throughout the world offer the services of healers who can help cure diseases.</p>
            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead><tr><th>Service</th><th>Process</th></tr></thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Treat Illness</td>
                        <td>Healer reviews symptoms and quotes price. If successful, fee collected in full. If cure not successful, healer only charges portion of quoted price.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Magic Healing</h3>
            <p>Certain healing spells can cure diseases. Magic users with appropriate spells can cast them during camp or at character review.</p>

            <h3>Remedies and Potions</h3>
            <p>Special herbal remedies and magical potions can cure specific diseases. These can be brewed through Alchemy or purchased from merchants.</p>

            <h2>Disease Effects</h2>
