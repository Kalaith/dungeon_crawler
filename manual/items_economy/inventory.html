            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Every character has a backpack where they can store up to 16 items, plus seven equipment slots on their
                body for items that are "equipped" and at the ready.</p>

            <h2>Backpack (16 Item Slots)</h2>
            <p>The backpack is the primary storage area for items not currently equipped.</p>

            <h3>Managing Backpack Items</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Select:</strong> Left click an item to select it (highlights red)</li>
                <li><strong>Examine:</strong> Click item, then click eye icon to see what it is and its condition</li>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Items that are dropped are gone forever. The system will ask for
                    confirmation before item disappears.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Equipment Slots (7 Body Slots)</h2>
            <p>In addition to backpacks, characters may carry seven items on their body. These items are considered
                "equipped" and at the ready.</p>

            <h3>The Seven Slots</h3>

            <h3>Equipping Items</h3>
            <p>To equip your character, select an item from inventory and drag it to the appropriate body icon. If you
                try to equip something your character can't wear, the system will let you know.</p>

            <h2>Special Equipment Slots</h2>

            <h3>Right Hand - Weapon Slot</h3>
            <p>The right hand is the weapon hand. This weapon will be at the ready should a monster approach. If
                characters don't have a weapon here and are attacked, they will have to arm themselves in the first
                round, losing precious time, or fight unarmed.</p>

            <h3>Left Hand - Quick Use Slot</h3>
            <p>The left hand is the potion, herb, shield, or missile hand. Items in the left hand are held ready for use
                at a moment's notice during combat.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Potions and herbs for quick healing</li>
                <li>Shields for defense</li>
                <li>Missiles/ammunition for ranged weapons</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Armor and Protection</h2>
            <p>Items that cover parts of the body work to improve Armor Class (AR). Each of the seven carrying slots
                represents a part of the body.</p>

            <h3>Armor Class (AC)</h3>
            <p>Shows how difficult it is to land a damaging hit on the character. Higher is better.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>10:</strong> Unarmored (Base AC)</li>
                <li><strong>11-14:</strong> Light Armor (Leather, Padded)</li>
                <li><strong>14-16:</strong> Medium Armor (Chain Shirt, Scale Mail)</li>
                <li><strong>16-20+:</strong> Heavy Armor & Shields (Plate, Shields)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Encumbrance (ENC)</h2>
            <p>A character can only carry so much before their knees start to buckle and back gives out. Encumbrance
                tracks this load and tells you how many ounces of armor, weapons, and supplies a character carries.</p>

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Maximum Capacity:</strong> 100 × Strength (ST) ounces</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Effects of High Encumbrance:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Characters who push limit or exceed it lose movement points</li>
                    <li>Not able to move as quickly or as much</li>
                    <li>Reduced combat effectiveness</li>
                    <li>Slower travel speed</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Eating & Drinking</h2>
            <p>To feed your characters or give them drink:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Review character</li>
                <li>Select item (waterskin or ration) from inventory</li>
                <li>Click on the mouth icon</li>
                <li>Character's hunger or thirst lines will reflect satisfaction</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> The mouth icon is also used to consume herbs or potions.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Inventory Management Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Essential Items to Carry</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adequate rations and waterskins</li>
                <li>Healing potions in left hand</li>
                <li>Backup weapon</li>
                <li>Lockpicks (for characters with Locks skill)</li>
                <li>Tinder box and torches/lanterns</li>
                <li>Emergency herbs and antidotes</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Weight Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Regularly check encumbrance levels</li>
                <li>Drop or sell unnecessary items</li>
                <li>Balance protection (armor) with mobility</li>
                <li>Distribute heavy items among stronger characters</li>
                <li>Consider using pack animals or carts for extended journeys</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Equipment Optimization</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Right Hand:</strong> Best weapon for character's skills</li>
                <li><strong>Left Hand:</strong> Healing potion during dangerous situations, shield during normal combat
                </li>
                <li><strong>Armor Slots:</strong> Best protection you can afford within encumbrance limits</li>
                <li><strong>Backpack:</strong> Essentials first, valuables second, excess last</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Combat Preparation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure right hand has weapon before entering dungeons or wilderness</li>
                <li>Keep healing item in left hand during dangerous areas</li>
                <li>Have backup weapon in backpack</li>
                <li>Check equipment condition regularly</li>
                <li>Repair damaged items before they break</li>
            </ul>
