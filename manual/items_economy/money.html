            <h2>Managing Your Funds</h2>
            <p>The game world is an equal opportunity world. All members of the party, man and woman alike, make an equal amount of money for their efforts. This money goes into the party's coffer with each character having an equal share. When your party visits a merchant, this money goes into a community slush fund, allowing the party to pool their money for goods that need to be purchased.</p>

            <h2>Currency System</h2>
            <p>The game uses a three-tier currency system:</p>

            <h3>Equal Shares</h3>
