            <h1>Market & Merchant</h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Throughout many towns and cities, you'll find numerous vendors peddling their wares in the cities' markets. In their booths, you can find the finest in armor, herbs, and other goods that your party may need on an occasional or daily basis. When you're in the area of such a market, the Visit Market icon will be available; otherwise, this icon will not appear.</p>

            <p>When you opt to enter the market, you will be shown a menu of vendors whose tables are out and about. Select one to enter their booth. Once inside, lots of options are available.</p>

            <h2>Market Options</h2>

            <h3>Buy Goods</h3>
            <p>The merchant allows you to look at their wares. The price along with a picture of each item is shown. The merchant also identifies the item as usable (yellow) or unusable (white) by highlighting the character's name.</p>

            <h4>Shopping Process:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Move the cursor box over an item to see its price and name</li>
                <li>The location and info line shows: "0 [Item Name]" - the "0" reflects the number of items currently in your shopping cart</li>
                <li>Click on an item to add it to cart (0 becomes 1)</li>
                <li>Click again for multiple quantities (1 becomes 2, etc.)</li>
                <li>Right-click to remove an item from cart</li>
                <li>Move through the list to see your selections (0 of this, 2 of that, 1 of another)</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Color Coding:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Item is usable by highlighted character</li>
                    <li><strong>White:</strong> Item is unusable by highlighted character</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Next / Previous Page</h3>
            <p>If a merchant has a large selection of goods, it may take more than one page to present it. Selecting these options, you move to the next page or the previous page in the merchant's catalog.</p>

            <h3>Haggle (Pay For Goods)</h3>
            <p>With items in your cart, you approach the merchant. Since they are the owner and chief executive officer of this sole proprietorship, the chance to dicker the merchant's price down is available to your party.</p>

            <h4>Haggling Process:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Select Haggle with items in cart</li>
                <li>You will be asked to enter the discount you're hoping for</li>
                <li>You'll see the range of bearable discount</li>
                <li>Enter the discount (10 for 10%, for example)</li>
                <li>Select a person to do the haggling (characters skilled in Haggle have the best chance)</li>
                <li>In Novice mode, the most skilled will be highlighted; in Advanced mode, you select the character yourself</li>
                <li>The vendor mulls over your offer</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Haggling Outcomes:</h4>
                <p>Depending on your tact, diplomacy, and haggling skill, the merchant may:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accept:</strong> Your offer is approved, purchase at discounted price</li>
                    <li><strong>Gripe:</strong> Merchant complains but may still negotiate</li>
                    <li><strong>Throw You Out:</strong> After three insulting offers, you're ejected from the shop</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Keep in mind that one ticked off merchant may pass word to another. Of course, if you feel the merchant's prices are good, or if you wish to impress them, you may enter "0" percent to purchase the items at their shelf price.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Sell</h3>
            <p>Maybe you're hard up for Ducats. Perhaps you have one too many daggers hanging around your belt. Whatever the reason, you're interested in selling some of your items. Just click Sell followed by a character to do so.</p>

            <h4>Selling Process:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Select Sell option</li>
                <li>Choose a character</li>
                <li>You'll see a catalog of your character's items along with the price the vendor is willing to pay</li>
                <li>In most cases, you'll see several silver crowns; however, if the merchant isn't interested, they'll offer 0 and refuse to take it</li>
                <li>Click on an item to sell it</li>
                <li>For multiple items (e.g., five food packets), the merchant will ask how many you wish to sell</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Haggle (When Selling)</h4>
            <p>Once you've selected the items you wish to sell, it's the merchant's turn to haggle your offer. You'll see their offer in the upper right portion of the screen and may take this opportunity to smooth talk them into offering you a better price. They may think you're dreaming when you ask them to double their offer, but then again, they may not.</p>

            <h4>Another Character</h4>
            <p>If another character wishes to sell items, click on their portrait to display the next character's wares.</p>

            <h3>Talk</h3>
            <p>Merchants see hundreds of folk every day. Passing through their booths, the travelers speak of the tales they have heard while on the road, people they have spoken with, and secrets they hope to uncover. With all this juicy news entering their ears, merchants tend to be the biggest gossipers in town!</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Talking to Merchants:</h4>
                <p>Just select Talk to get in on the action. Many times the merchant will tell you of rumors they've heard. Other times they may become irritated at something offensive you've said. And there's also the merchants who, having spent years in the market, are tuned out to all its hustle and bustle and haven't taken in a thing to tell you.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Leave</h3>
            <p>When you've finished, or if you are not interested in the items offered, select Leave to return to the main market offerings.</p>

            <h2>Pick-Pocketing A Merchant</h2>
            <p>If you're a bit low on cash, you may be able to pickpocket the very merchant you're trying to buy goods from!</p>

            <h4>How To Pickpocket:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Review a character</li>
                <li>Right-click to get the Options Menu</li>
                <li>Select Use Talent</li>
                <li>Choose Pickpocket</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Risk vs. Reward:</strong> If luck is with you, a few of their coins may be yours. If you get caught, though, it could cost you plenty.</p>
            </div>
