        <header><h1>Herbs & Alchemy</h1></header>
        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Used in every alchemist's potion, herbs are a source of magical power for the party and are plentiful in forests throughout the world.</p>

            <h2>Gathering Herbs</h2>
            <p>While camping, characters can gather herbs by selecting the Gather Herbs option and choosing a character for the search.</p>

            <h3>Success Factors</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Area Searched:</strong> Different regions have different herbs</li>
                <li><strong>Herb Lore Skill:</strong> Higher skill finds herbs more quickly</li>
                <li><strong>Perception:</strong> Helps spot herbs that others miss</li>
                <li><strong>Identification:</strong> Skilled characters better at identifying herbs correctly</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Herb Lore Skill</h2>
            <p>The Herb Lore skill (WD/IN/DX) represents not just knowledge of where to find herbs, but also the ability to correctly identify and prepare them.</p>

            <h2>Alchemy System</h2>

            <h3>Requirements for Brewing</h3>
            <p>To mix potions, the character must have:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An Alchemy set</li>
                <li>All necessary containers</li>
                <li>All necessary herbs</li>
                <li>An appropriate recipe</li>
                <li>Solid skill in Herb Lore and Alchemy helps</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Alchemy Skill</h3>
            <p>The Alchemy skill (CR/WD/DX) governs the recognition and, most importantly, the preparation of potions and elixirs.</p>

            <h3>Brewing Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>At camp, select Use Skill and choose Alchemy</li>
                <li>Select character with Alchemy skill</li>
                <li>Choose the recipe to follow</li>
                <li>Character begins mixing the brew</li>
                <li>You will know the outcome when complete</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Brewing Outcomes</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Success</h4>
                <p>Potion is created successfully and added to character's inventory.</p>

                <h4>Failure</h4>
                <p>If the alchemist puts together a brew that melts the very jars in which it was concocted, they will fail the attempt, and all ingredients and containers used in the mix will be lost. After all, who wants a potion that doesn't work or a flask with residue of failed attempt on it?</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Using Herbs and Potions</h2>

            <h2>Types of Effects</h2>
