                Character classes define your character's role in the party, their combat abilities,
                and their approach to challenges. Each class has unique strengths, weaknesses, and
                special abilities that make them valuable in different situations.

                        Jesters are wanderers of the road, entertainers and tricksters who use wit,
                        charm, and agility to survive. They excel at social manipulation, stealth,
                        and getting into (and out of) trouble. While they lack combat prowess and
                        magical abilities, their diverse skill set makes them invaluable for
                        reconnaissance, negotiation, and unconventional problem-solving.

                        Hunters are masters of the wilderness, skilled trackers and survivalists who
                        thrive in natural environments. They possess keen senses, knowledge of flora
                        and fauna, and the ability to navigate even the most treacherous terrain.
                        Hunters are excellent scouts and ranged combatants, though they lack magical
                        abilities.

                        Warriors are strong and hardy individuals, trained in the arts of combat and
                        physical prowess. They serve as the frontline defenders of any party, capable
                        of withstanding tremendous punishment while dealing devastating blows to their
                        enemies. Members of this class excel in melee combat and can wear the heaviest
                        armor, though they have no magical abilities.

                        Rogues are masters of stealth, deception, and precision. They specialize in
                        infiltration, trap detection and disarmament, and striking from the shadows.
                        While not as durable as Warriors, Rogues make up for it with cunning, agility,
                        and the ability to exploit enemy weaknesses. They are essential for navigating
                        dangerous dungeons and urban environments.

                    <p>
                        Warlocks are practitioners of pact magic, drawing power from otherworldly
                        patrons through bargains and agreements. Their magic is versatile and often
                        carries a darker edge, focusing on curses, hexes, and eldritch powers.
                        Warlocks blend social skills with magical prowess, making them effective
                        both in and out of combat.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Magic Style:</strong> Warlock magic is characterized by its pact-based
                        nature and reliance on Charisma. Warlocks can cast fewer spells than other
                        casters but recover their magical energy more quickly. Their spells often
                        involve manipulation, control, and dealing damage through eldritch forces.

                    <p>
                        Sorcerers are born with innate magical abilities flowing through their veins,
                        often due to a magical bloodline or supernatural event. Unlike Wizards who
                        study magic academically, Sorcerers channel raw magical energy instinctively.
                        Their magic is spontaneous and powerful, though less versatile than studied
                        spellcasting.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Magic Style:</strong> Sorcerer magic is innate and Charisma-based,
                        allowing for powerful metamagic abilities that can modify spells on the fly.
                        Sorcerers know fewer spells than Wizards but can cast them more flexibly,
                        making them excellent at adapting to unexpected situations.

                        Wizards are scholarly spellcasters who have mastered magic through years of
                        study and practice. They possess the most extensive spell repertoire of any
                        class and can learn virtually any spell given enough time and resources.
                        Wizards are physically frail but intellectually formidable, capable of solving
                        problems through knowledge and magical power.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Magic Style:</strong> Wizard magic is Intelligence-based and requires
                        preparation. Wizards must study their spellbooks and prepare specific spells
                        each day, but they have access to the largest variety of magical effects,
                        from devastating combat spells to powerful utility magic.

                        allies, smite enemies, and provide spiritual guidance. They serve as the
                        party's primary healers and support casters, though they can also hold their
                        own in melee combat with divine blessings. Clerics balance martial prowess

                        Druids are guardians of nature who draw their power from the natural world.
                        They can shapeshift into animals, command the forces of nature, and communicate
                        with beasts. Druids are versatile spellcasters who excel in outdoor environments
                        and can serve multiple roles within a party through their shapeshifting abilities.

                        can wild shape into various animal forms, gaining their physical abilities
                        while retaining their mental faculties. Their spells often involve plants,

                        while also casting spells. Magicians are particularly skilled at magical

            <h2>Party Composition Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                A well-balanced party typically includes a mix of combat specialists, support
                characters, and utility experts. Consider including:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><strong>Magical Support:</strong> Clerics, Druids, Warlocks (1-2 characters)</li>
                <li><strong>Utility Specialists:</strong> Rogues, Jesters, Magicians (1 character)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> Parties can have up to 6 members. The specific composition

            <h2>Multiclassing</h2>
            <p>
                Characters may choose to train in multiple classes, gaining abilities from each.
                However, multiclassing requires meeting the attribute requirements for all chosen
                classes and may slow overall progression. Consult with your Game Master about
                multiclassing rules and restrictions.
