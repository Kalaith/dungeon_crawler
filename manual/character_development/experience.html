        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Gaining Levels</h2>
            <p>As your characters travel, they will gain experience points as they face numerous foes, perform herculean
                tasks, and overcome other perils. When your characters accumulate enough experience points, they become
                eligible for new experience levels. These levels, along with all their benefits, are granted in towns.
            </p>

            <h2>Experience Point Requirements</h2>
            <p>There is no maximum level in the game. Experience requirements follow a progressive formula, allowing
                characters to grow indefinitely as long as they continue their adventures.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>The Experience Formula</h3>
                <p>The experience points (EP) required to reach a specific level (L) are calculated as follows:</p>
                <div class="formula">
                    EP = 5000 × (L - 1) × L / 2
                </div>
                <p><em>Where L is the target level.</em></p>
                <p>For example, to reach Level 4:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>L = 4</li>
                    <li>EP = 5000 × (3) × 4 / 2</li>
                    <li>EP = 5000 × 12 / 2</li>
                    <li>EP = 30,000</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <p>With the exception of Elves, magic users may convert between skill increase attempts and spell
                    increase attempts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Convert skill increase attempts into spell increase attempts</li>
                    <li>Convert spell increase attempts into skill increase attempts</li>

                <h4>Astral Point Conversion (Magicians and Magiciennes Only):</h4>
                <p>Magicians and Magiciennes may forgo some spell increase attempts in return for astral points.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trade spell increase attempts for permanent AP increases</li>
                    <li>Strategic choice between immediate power (AP) and long-term versatility (spell increases)</li>

            <h2>Level-Up Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Accumulate Experience:</strong> Gain EP through combat, quests, and overcoming challenges
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reach Town:</strong> Levels are granted only in towns where citizens recognize your deeds
                </li>
                <li><strong>Level Up:</strong> Character automatically levels when EP threshold is reached in town</li>
                <li><strong>Attribute Increase:</strong> Choose one positive attribute to increase (decrease 2 negative
                    points)</li>
                <li><strong>Life/Astral Points:</strong> Receive LP increase (and possibly AP for magic users)</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced Mode Only:</strong> Use skill and spell increase attempts</li>
                <li><strong>Save Game:</strong> It's a good idea to save your game at the nearest temple after gaining a
                    level</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Levels are granted in towns only. Creatures in the wilderness do not
                    recognize your achievements. Plan your journeys to ensure you can reach a town when close to
                    leveling up.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Strategic Considerations</h2>

            <h3>Attribute Choices</h3>
            <p>When choosing which positive attribute to increase, consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your character's role in the party</li>
                <li>Weaknesses that need shoring up</li>
                <li>Strengths that could be enhanced</li>
                <li>Requirements for future Class abilities</li>
                <li>Which negative attributes you can afford to increase</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Skill vs. Spell Priorities</h3>
            <p>For magic users in Advanced mode, decide between:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spell Focus:</strong> Use all attempts on spells for powerful magic</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Approach:</strong> Split between skills and spells for versatility</li>
                <li><strong>Skill Focus:</strong> Prioritize non-magical abilities for a hybrid character</li>
                <li><strong>AP Investment:</strong> Trade spell attempts for permanent astral power</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Combat Skill Development</h3>
            <p>When increasing combat skills, you can adjust AT and PA values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Offensive Build:</strong> Maximize AT for aggressive combat style</li>
                <li><strong>Defensive Build:</strong> Maximize PA for survivability</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Build:</strong> Split evenly between AT and PA</li>
            </ul>
