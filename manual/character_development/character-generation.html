            <h2>Creating Your Characters</h2>
            <p>Creating your own characters is an important part of any fantasy role playing experience. You may create your party in any one of four different ways and on two different levels. The Advanced Mode allows you full control over each character's statistics while the Novice Mode provides you with the fastest and easiest way to create a character.</p>

            <h2>Generation Modes</h2>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Advanced Mode</h3>
                <p>Full control over each character's statistics, skills, attack and parry values, and spell increases.</p>

                <h3>Novice Mode</h3>
                <p>Automatic skill and spell increases, with all calculations handled automatically.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Deciding On An Class</h2>
            <p>Before you begin rolling your characters, it's important to determine what types of characters you hope to create. A character's profession is known as his or her Class. Your characters may pursue any one of twelve Archetypes.</p>

            <h2>Character Creation Steps</h2>

            <h3>1. Selecting a Name</h3>
            <p>You may name your character anything you like, but names will be abbreviated if over seven letters.</p>

            <h3>2. Selecting a Gender</h3>
            <p>Characters may be male or female. Men and women are equally skilled, talented and trained. You may change their gender anytime prior to saving the character.</p>

            <h3>3. Choosing Your Course Of Action</h3>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Choose Class</h4>
                <p>Allows you to choose the profession your character will follow from any of the twelve Archetypes available, and assigns the minimum attribute values for that Class to the character.</p>

                <h4>New Attributes</h4>
                <p>You take the dice into your hands. Following the minimum entrance requirements for your Class, you manually distribute the attribute values to qualify for the Class. Characters who are hand crafted in this manner have higher overall attributes than those created with Choose Class.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Attributes System</h2>

            <h3>Positive Attributes</h3>
            <p>The seven positive attributes are tracked numerically and, for newly created characters, range from 8 to 13.</p>

            <h2>Attribute Assignment</h2>

            <h3>Rolling Attributes</h3>
            <p>When you select New Attributes, the system rolls values for positive attributes (left column) and negative attributes (right column). Each roll can be placed in any attribute slot depending on the Class you're hoping to create.</p>

            <h3>Select Class</h3>
            <p>After assigning attribute values, choose Select Class. The system will show a list of Archetypes your character qualifies for. If you don't qualify for any Class, you can use Change Attribute to modify current values or select New Attributes to re-roll.</p>

            <h3>Change Attributes</h3>
            <p>This option allows you to alter both positive and negative attributes by trading off points between the two.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Trading Rules:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>For every 1 point change to a positive attribute, you must make a 2 point change to negative attributes</li>
                    <li>For every 2 point decrease in negative attributes, you must decrease 1 point from a positive attribute</li>
                    <li>Positive attributes cannot go below 8 or above 13</li>
                    <li>Negative attributes cannot go below 2 or above 8</li>
                    <li>Once you begin changing an attribute in one direction, you may not reverse it later</li>
                    <li>You may continue adjusting in the same direction</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Choose Class Method</h3>
            <p>If you prefer to select your Class without rolling attribute values yourself, the system will do it for you. However, characters created by this method have certain drawbacks:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Attribute values will be the minimum amount required for entrance into the Class</li>
                <li>Positive attributes will not be above 12 (versus 13 for manually created characters)</li>
                <li>Negative attributes will not be below 3 (versus 2 for manually created characters)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Choosing An Arcane Lore</h3>
            <p>If you created a magician or Magician, you will be asked to choose the character's preferred arcane lore. Arcane lore influences the character's magical focus and affects spell casting skill for the selected category. In Advanced mode, magic users can convert increase attempts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trade spell increase attempts for skill attempts or vice versa</li>
                <li>Give up 10 spell increase attempts for an additional 10 astral points (AP)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Choosing A Portrait</h3>
            <p>After choosing your Class, a selection of portraits appropriate for your character's Class and gender will be shown.</p>

            <h2>Additional Character Attributes</h2>

            <h3>Money</h3>
            <p>Currency in the game world uses a three-tier system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gold Ducats (D):</strong> Highest form of currency</li>
                <li><strong>Silver Crowns (S):</strong> 10 Silver Crowns = 1 Gold Ducat</li>
                <li><strong>Copper Bits (B):</strong> 10 Copper Bits = 1 Silver Crown</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Starting money is determined by character make up and a bit of luck.</p>

            <h3>Physical Attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Height and Weight:</strong> Define physical aspects based on selected Class</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Deity</h3>
            <p>A character's deity is very important. Based upon the month the character is born, the deity determines the character's general way of life and may offer bonuses to attribute or skill values. Throughout this world, temples offer respite for travelers, and occasionally, characters in need may enjoy divine help. Steady worship and sacrifice will go a long way toward making a favorable impression.</p>

            <h3>Life Points (LP)</h3>
            <p>Represent the amount of damage a character can take before death. Life points are based upon statistics and increase with experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>At 5 or fewer LP, character will lose consciousness</li>
                <li>Character dies at 0 LP</li>
                <li>Life points can be regained through sleep, potions, or magical intervention</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Astral Points (AP)</h3>
            <p>All kinds of magic are powered by astral energy measured in astral points. These points represent the amount of magical power your character has and the amount of points available to cast spells. Astral points are based upon character's Class, increase with experience, and are replenished through sleep, potions, or meditation.</p>

            <h3>Endurance</h3>
            <p>Reflects character's ability to withstand strain. Key factor in movement points available and how much burden can be tolerated before sacrificing movement points.</p>
            <div class="formula">
                <p>Endurance = Based on Life Points (LP) + Strength (ST)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Magic Resistance (MR)</h3>
            <p>Represents character's ability to ward off the effects of magical spells.</p>
            <div class="formula">
                <p>Magic Resistance = Based on Courage (CR) + Wisdom (WD) + Superstition (SN)</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Advanced Mode Only</h2>

            <h3>Increasing Skill Values</h3>
            <p>In Advanced mode, characters are given a set of statistic values that reflect standard training for their Class. You receive remaining attempts (typically 20, varies by Class) to increase skills you consider important.</p>

            <h4>To Attempt a Skill Increase:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Move to the skill screen that contains the skill you want to increase</li>
                <li>Open the Skill Increase Menu</li>
                <li>Select a skill group</li>
                <li>Choose a skill to increase - the system rolls a die to determine success or failure</li>
                <li>Repeat until all skill attempts are used</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Skill Increase Limits:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Combat and Intuitive skills:</strong> Cannot be increased by more than 1 point when creating characters or gaining levels</li>
                    <li><strong>Knowledge skills:</strong> Cannot be increased by more than 3 points when creating characters or gaining levels</li>
                    <li><strong>All other skill areas:</strong> Cannot be increased by more than 2 points per level</li>
                    <li>If you increase a Combat skill, you will increase both attack and parry values</li>
                    <li>You have 3 attempts available to increase any one skill</li>
                    <li>Highest skill value possible: +18</li>
                    <li>Lowest skill value possible: -20</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Changing Attack And Parry Values</h3>
            <p>Attack and parry values reflect statistics and combat skills and determine how characters perform in combat.</p>

            <h4>Understanding The Values</h4>
            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>

            </table>

            <h4>Modifying The Values</h4>
            <p>You may change individual AT (attack) and PA (parry) values to suit your preference. To calculate the total available points:</p>
            <div class="formula">
                <p>Total = AT Basic Value + PA Basic Value + SV (skill value)</p>
            </div>

            <p>You may split this number between the Mode's AT and PA values any way you like, so long as they do not fall below the AT or PA Basic Values.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Values for missile weapons and thrown weapons may not be changed. If a character has a negative combat skill value, no adjustments can be made - the negative value is subtracted from the Basic Skill values to produce AT and PA values.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Increasing Spell Values</h3>
            <p>Magic users in Advanced mode may increase their current spell values. Characters receive a certain amount of attempts to increase spell values based on their Class.</p>

            <h2>Saving Your Character</h2>
            <p>Once you're happy with your character, select Save Hero to add your character to the ranks of the elite adventurers. If your character profile is incomplete, or if another character by the same name already exists, the system will let you know.</p>

            <h3>New Hero</h3>
            <p>Select New Hero to create another character. This is also helpful if your current character isn't working out and you'd like to begin anew with a fresh slate of attributes.</p>

            <p>You may create as many characters as you like, and select up to six to join you in your adventure. Newly created characters may be added to your party at temples in the game world.</p>
