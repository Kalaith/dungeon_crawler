            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Characters have certain levels of wisdom, dexterity, and strength among other statistics. Attributes are
                split into two categories: positive attributes and negative attributes. Both types are tracked
                numerically and affect various aspects of gameplay.</p>

            <h2>Positive Attributes</h2>
            <p>The eight positive attributes are tracked numerically and, for newly created characters, range from 8 to
                13.</p>

                            subconscious processing and luck. This attribute is vital for intuitive magic users
                            (Warlocks, Witches, Elves) who rely on feeling rather than formula.</td>

            <h2>Attribute Modifiers</h2>
            <p>Each attribute generates a <strong>modifier</strong> used for skill checks, attack rolls, saving throws,
                and other game mechanics. This bridges RoA's attribute system with D&D's resolution mechanics.</p>

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Modifier Formula:</strong><br>
                    Modifier = (Attribute - 10) / 2 (rounded down)</p>
            </div>

            <table class="stat-table">

            </table>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting characters have attributes 8-13 (modifiers +0 to +1). As characters
                    level up, attributes can increase beyond 13, providing higher modifiers.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Derived Stats</h2>
            <p>Derived statistics like Health Points (HP), Astral Points (AP), and Armor Class (AC) are calculated
                directly from these RoA attributes and their modifiers. Monsters also use this same attribute scale,
                though powerful
                creatures like Dragons may exceed the standard 8-13 range.</p>

            <h2>Saving Throws</h2>
            <p>When you need to resist effects (poison, spells, traps), you make a saving throw using the appropriate
                attribute modifier:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Strength Saves:</strong> Use ST modifier (resisting being pushed, grappled)</li>
                <li><strong>Dexterity Saves:</strong> Use AG modifier (dodging fireballs, avoiding traps)</li>
                <li><strong>Constitution Saves:</strong> Use CO modifier (resisting poison, disease, death)</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligence Saves:</strong> Use IT modifier (resisting mental illusions)</li>
                <li><strong>Wisdom Saves:</strong> Use WD modifier (resisting charms, fear)</li>
                <li><strong>Charisma Saves:</strong> Use CH modifier (resisting possession, banishment)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Magic System (Hybrid)</h2>
            <p>Spells use <strong>Astral Points (AP)</strong> as the resource pool. The spell's effectiveness is
                determined by your <strong>Spell Save DC</strong> and <strong>Spell Attack Bonus</strong>, which are
                calculated from your spellcasting attribute (Intelligence for Wizards, Wisdom for Clerics, etc.).</p>

            <h2>Negative Attributes</h2>
            <p>The seven negative attributes range from 2 to 8 for new characters. Archetypes have negative attribute
                requirements as well.</p>

            <h2>Attribute Assignment During Character Creation</h2>

            <h3>Rolling and Placing Attributes</h3>
            <p>When creating a character, you'll see an initial roll on your screen. This roll can be used for any of
                the eight positive attributes; you select which one depending on the Class you're hoping to create.
                After placing the first value, the system will roll again until you have placed each roll with a
                positive statistic.</p>

            <p>Next, you'll assign values for the negative statistics just like you did for positive attributes. Keep in
                mind that Archetypes have negative attribute requirements as well.</p>

            <h3>Selecting Class</h3>
            <p>After assigning your character's attribute values, choose Select Class. The system will show you a
                list of Archetypes your character qualifies for. Just select one to make it official.</p>

            <p>At times, however, you may see that the character you've created doesn't qualify for any Class at
                all. The system will tell you that you've failed to meet the minimum entrance requirements. You don't
                need to start over - select the Change Attribute option to modify current values, or select New
                Attributes to re-roll.</p>

            <h2>Change Attributes System</h2>

            <p>When you've placed all of your rolls and are still just one or two points away from your desired
                Class, Change Attributes allows you to alter both positive and negative attributes by trading off
                points between the two.</p>

            <h3>How Trading Works</h3>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Increasing Positive Attributes</h4>
                <p>For every 1 point increase to a positive attribute, you must make a 2 point increase to negative
                    attributes.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Select the positive attribute to increase</li>
                    <li>The system shows you a menu of negative attributes</li>
                    <li>Choose to increase your negative attributes by 2 points total</li>
                    <li>You may put both increases in one attribute or split them between two different attributes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Decreasing Negative Attributes</h4>
                <p>You can decrease 2 points from your negative attributes by choosing to remove 1 point from a positive
                    attribute.</p>
            </div>
