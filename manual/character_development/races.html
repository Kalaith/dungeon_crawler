            <h1>Races</h1>
        </header>
        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Your Race defines your character's biological and cultural heritage. Some races have innate magical
                abilities that persist regardless of their chosen Class. While your Class defines your profession, your
                Race defines who you <em>are</em>.</p>

            <h2>What Race Determines</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Height, weight, lifespan, and appearance.</li>
                <li><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Magical abilities that are part of your bloodline (if any).</li>
                <li><strong>Racial Attribute Requirements:</strong> Minimum stats typical for your people.</li>
                <li><strong>Cultural Background:</strong> The traditions and values you were raised with.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Attribute Legend</h3>
                <p><strong>Positive Attributes:</strong> CR (Courage), WD (Wisdom), IT (Intelligence), CH (Charisma), DX
                    (Dexterity), AG (Agility), ST (Strength), IN (Intuition)</p>
                <p><strong>Negative Attributes:</strong> SN (Superstition), AC (Acrophobia), CL (Claustrophobia), AV
                    (Avarice), NE (Necrophobia), CU (Curiosity), VT (Violent Temper)</p>
                <p>Numbers indicate minimum required values. &lt;4 means maximum value of 3.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Races</h2>

            <h3>Human</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> None</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Adaptable, Ambitious</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> None</p>
                <p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> +5 Skill Increase Attempts (Total 25 base)</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Diverse height and build, 5-6 ft tall</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Adulthood ~18 years, live up to 80 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. Lacking the innate magic of
                elves
                or the stone-hard resilience of dwarves, humans make up for it with sheer drive and versatility. They
                can
                excel in any profession, from the most physical Warrior to the most scholarly Magician.</p>

            <h3>Thorwalian</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> CR 12, ST 13, SN 7</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Seafaring, Battle Lust</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> None</p>
            </div>
            <p>The hulking Thorwalians, equally honored and feared as sailors and fighters, are particularly well known
                for good living and a lust for battle (be it against others or the forces of nature). These hardy
                warriors combine seafaring expertise with formidable combat abilities, thriving in harsh northern
                climates and embracing both celebration and conflict with equal enthusiasm.</p>

            <h3>Dwarf & Dwarvess</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> DX 12, ST 13, CL &lt;4, AV 7</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Smithing, Stonecunning, Poison Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> None</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Short stature (4-5 ft), stocky build (~150 lbs), exceptional
                    endurance</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Mature at 50, live ~350 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>The little People are excellent smiths, and can value jewelry and other precious items with great
                accuracy. Their hands and eyes are also accurate with an axe; once sighted, a target is seldom missed.
                Dwarves are known for their resilience, their affinity for stonework and underground environments, and
                their unwavering loyalty to clan and tradition.</p>
            <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Dwarves possess natural resistance to poison and disease, keen awareness
                when working with stone (Stonecunning), and innate proficiency with traditional dwarven weapons
                (battleaxe, handaxe, warhammer). Their lack of fear of enclosed spaces (CL &lt;4) reflects their comfort
                in mines and underground halls. Many dwarves are naturally drawn to wealth and craftsmanship (AV 7),
                taking pride in creating and collecting fine works.</p>
            <p><strong>Cultural Notes:</strong> Dwarven society values order, craftsmanship, and fair dealing. They are
                typically lawful in nature, believing in the strength of tradition and community. Their smithing skills
                are legendary, producing weapons and armor of exceptional quality.</p>

            <h3>Green Elves</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> IT 13, AG 12, AV &lt;4</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Nature Affinity, Fey Ancestry, Trance</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Natural (20 Spell Attempts)</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Innate magic stacks with Class magic.</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Slender build, 5-6 ft tall, graceful movement</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Adulthood ~100 years, live up to 750 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>Of all the elven folk, the Green Elves have had the closest contact with humans. They are not adverse to
                sitting 'round campfires discussing a day's events and are occasionally spotted in taverns. While slight
                of stature, Green Elves possess a great deal of magic and skill with missile weapons and have much in
                common with Human mages. They are also very self-disciplined.</p>
            <p><strong>Elven Traits:</strong> Green Elves possess keen senses (proficiency in Perception), resistance to
                magical charm effects (Fey Ancestry), and need only meditate for 4 hours instead of sleeping 8 (Trance).
                Their natural agility and grace make them excellent archers and acrobats. Unlike other elves, Green
                Elves are comfortable in both wilderness and civilization.</p>
            <p><strong>Cultural Integration:</strong> Green Elves serve as bridges between elven and human societies.
                They appreciate both the timeless beauty of elven traditions and the vibrant energy of human innovation.
                This makes them excellent diplomats, though their low avarice (AV &lt;4) means they're motivated by
                curiosity and friendship rather than material gain.</p>

            <h3>Ice Elves</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> AG 13, IN 12, AC &lt;4</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Cold Resistance, Endurance, Perception</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Unknown/Sensory (20 Spell Attempts)</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Innate magic stacks with Class magic.</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Pale complexion, adapted to cold, exceptional endurance</p>
            </div>
            <p>Very few members of the Ice family have ventured beyond their native grounds, and they are seldom seen in
                southern areas. They seem to possess an almost unknown magical sense, and their spells often puzzle
                magic users of a more traditional mould. Also a puzzle to outsiders is their remarkable endurance and
                keen sense of perception. They're also not too shabby when it comes to using missile weapons.</p>
            <p><strong>Elven Heritage:</strong> Ice Elves share the standard elven traits - keen senses, fey ancestry,
                and trance - but have adapted to harsh arctic environments. Their lack of acrophobia (AC &lt;4) may
                relate to their comfort with high mountain peaks and ice cliffs in their homeland.</p>
            <p><strong>Mysterious Magic:</strong> Ice Elf magic is described as "unknown" and puzzling to traditional
                casters, suggesting they may use unique magical traditions not found in standard spellbooks. This could
                involve ice and cold magic, spirit communion, or even primal magic tied to the aurora and winter storms.
                Their magical style may be more intuitive than the scholarly approach of Magicians, yet different from
                the nature-based magic of Druids.</p>
            <p><strong>Arctic Adaptation:</strong> Ice Elves possess remarkable endurance, allowing them to survive in
                conditions that would kill others. They likely have natural resistance to cold and the ability to
                navigate through snow and ice with ease. Their keen perception helps them spot threats in the monotonous
                white landscape of their homeland.</p>

            <h3>Silvan Elves</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> AG 13, IN 13, AV &lt;4</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Forest Survival, Archery, Intuition</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Forest (20 Spell Attempts)</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Innate magic stacks with Class magic.</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Lithe and graceful, perfectly adapted to forest life</p>
            </div>
            <p>Silvan Elves live a secluded life in the dense forests. There they provide for themselves and are almost
                entirely self-sufficient. Needless to say, they have developed great nature and survival skills. They
                are also acknowledged masters of the bow, and possess a well-rounded understanding of the magical
                elements.</p>
            <p><strong>Elven Mastery:</strong> Silvan Elves represent the pinnacle of traditional elven culture - living
                in harmony with nature, mastering archery to an art form, and wielding magic as naturally as breathing.
                They share all standard elven traits but have honed them to perfection through their isolated forest
                existence.</p>
            <p><strong>Forest Guardians:</strong> Silvan Elves view themselves as protectors of the ancient forests.
                They know every tree, stream, and animal in their territory. Their archery skills are legendary - they
                can shoot through dense foliage without disturbing a leaf, and their arrows always find their mark.
                Their magic is woven into the forest itself, allowing them to call upon trees for aid, speak with
                animals, and move through the woods without leaving a trace.</p>
            <p><strong>Self-Sufficiency:</strong> Unlike Green Elves who interact with other races, Silvan Elves have
                little need or desire for outside contact. They craft their own bows, weave their own clothes from
                natural materials, and sustain themselves entirely from the forest's bounty. This isolation has
                preserved their ancient ways but also makes them seem mysterious and otherworldly to outsiders.</p>

            <h3>Halfling</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> DX 13, CH 12, AC 7</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Brave, Nimble, Lucky</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> None</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Small stature (3 ft), ~40 lbs, nimble fingers</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Adulthood ~20 years, live ~150 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>The diminutive Halflings are known for their practical minds, kind hearts, and surprising courage. While
                they love the comforts of home—good food, fine drink, and a warm hearth—they possess a unique luck and
                resilience that serves them well when forced into adventure. Their small size allows them to move
                through
                spaces others cannot, and their natural stealth makes them excellent burglars or scouts.</p>

            <h3>Gnome</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> IT 13, DX 12, CU 7</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Darkvision, Gnome Cunning, Artificer's Lore</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Illusion/Tech (20 Spell Attempts)</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Small (3-4 ft), expressive faces, vibrant energy</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Adulthood ~40 years, live 350-500 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>Gnomes are a race of boundless energy, curiosity, and invention. Whether they are scholars, engineers, or
                tricksters, gnomes approach life with an enthusiasm that other races find exhausting. They have a
                natural
                affinity for illusions and mechanical contraptions, often blending the two into unique forms of magic.
                Their "Gnome Cunning" gives them a mental resilience against magic that targets the mind.</p>

            <h3>Dragonborn</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> ST 13, CH 12, VT 7</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Draconic Ancestry, Damage Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Breath Weapon (Special Ability)</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Tall (>6 ft), heavy build, scaled skin, draconic head</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Adulthood ~15 years, live ~80 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the Dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them
                with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally
                hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. They
                value honor and clan above all else. Their most fearsome ability is their breath weapon—a destructive
                exhalation of fire, cold, lightning, acid, or poison, inherited from their draconic ancestors.</p>

            <h3>Tiefling</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> CH 13, IT 12, SN &lt;4</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Darkvision, Hellish Resistance</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> Infernal (20 Spell Attempts)</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Horns, thick tail, sharp teeth, skin in shades of red/human</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Similar to humans, slightly longer</p>
            </div>
            <p>To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
                fear in every eye: this is the lot of the Tiefling. Bearing the physical mark of an infernal bloodline,
                tieflings possess a natural command of darkness and fire. Despite their demonic appearance, they are not
                inherently evil; many strive to be heroes, though their independent nature and the prejudice they face
                often lead them to self-reliance and a certain cynicism.</p>

            <h3>Half-Elf</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <p><strong>Racial Requirements:</strong> CH 13, AG 12, AV &lt;4</p>
                <p><strong>Racial Traits:</strong> Fey Ancestry, Darkvision, Skill Versatility</p>
                <p><strong>Innate Magic:</strong> None (Versatile)</p>
                <p><strong>Physical Traits:</strong> Blend of human and elven features, ears slightly pointed</p>
                <p><strong>Lifespan:</strong> Adulthood ~20 years, live >180 years</p>
            </div>
            <p>Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, Half-Elves combine what some say are the best
                qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the
                refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. They are natural diplomats and
                wanderers, often possessing a versatility that rivals humans, enhanced by the fey grace of their elven
                heritage.</p>

            <h2>Creating Unique Combinations</h2>
            <p>By mixing Races and Classes, you can create specialized characters with unique strengths:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Dwarf Magician:</strong> A rare but powerful combination. The Dwarf's high Constitution and
                    discipline (ST 13, AV 7) combined with the Magician's intellect creates a "Battle Mage" capable of
                    holding their own in melee while casting spells.</li>
                <li><strong>Green Elf Warrior:</strong> A deadly mix of martial prowess and innate magic. They combine
                    the
                    Warrior's heavy armor and weapon skills with the Elf's natural agility and minor spellcasting
                    abilities.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Thorwalian Druid:</strong> A "Storm Caller" Class. The Thorwalian's raw physical power
                    and
                    connection to the sea blends with the Druid's nature magic to control weather and elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Human Jester:</strong> The ultimate specialist. With the Human's extra skill attempts and
                    the
                    Jester's versatility, this character can master a vast array of social and survival skills.</li>
