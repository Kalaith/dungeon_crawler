            <h1>Derived Statistics</h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Derived statistics are calculated from your character's primary attributes and Class. These
                statistics play crucial roles in gameplay, affecting everything from survival to combat effectiveness to
                magical ability.</p>

            <h2>Primary Derived Statistics</h2>

            <h3>Health Points (HP)</h3>
            <p>Represent the amount of damage a character can take before death. A character's Health Points are based
                upon their statistics and increase with experience.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Health Points Mechanics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Based on character's Constitution (CO) and Strength (ST)</li>
                    <li>Increase with experience</li>
                    <li><strong>At 5 or fewer HP:</strong> Character will lose consciousness</li>
                    <li><strong>At 0 HP:</strong> Character dies</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Health Points can be regained through sleep, potions, or magical
                        intervention</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Astral Points (AP)</h3>
            <p>All kinds of magic are powered by astral energy which is measured in astral points. These points
                represent the amount of magical power your character has and the amount of points available to cast
                spells.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Astral Points Mechanics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Based upon character's Class</li>
                    <li>Increase with experience</li>
                    <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Replenished through sleep, potions, or meditation</li>
                    <li>Each spell cast consumes a specific amount of AP</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Endurance</h3>
            <p>Reflects your character's ability to withstand strain and is a key factor in how much burden can be
                tolerated before suffering exhaustion or penalties.</p>

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Endurance Calculation:</strong><br>
                    Based on Health Points (HP) + Constitution (CO)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Magic Resistance (MR)</h3>
            <p>Represents a character's ability to ward off the effects of magical spells.</p>

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Magic Resistance Calculation:</strong><br>
                    Based on Courage (CR) + Wisdom (WD) + Superstition (SN)</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Secondary Derived Statistics</h2>
            <p>Once characters are generated and have joined your party, they acquire three new secondary statistics,
                each of which are seen in the character review.</p>

            <h3>Encumbrance (ENC)</h3>
            <p>A character can only carry so much before their knees start to buckle and back gives out. Encumbrance
                tracks this load, and tells you how many ounces of armor, weapons, and supplies a character carries.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Encumbrance Rules:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maximum Capacity:</strong> 100 × Strength (ST) ounces</li>
                    <li>Characters who push the limit or exceed it suffer penalties to Initiative and physical checks
                    </li>
                    <li>Affects how quickly a character can react in combat</li>
                    <li>Tracks total weight of armor, weapons, and supplies</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Maximum Encumbrance:</strong><br>
                    100 × ST (in ounces)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Initiative (Speed)</h3>
            <p>Initiative determines the order in which characters and enemies act during combat. A higher initiative
                means acting earlier in the round, allowing you to strike first, heal allies before they fall, or
                control the battlefield.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Initiative Mechanics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> d20 + AG Modifier + IN Modifier (if IN ≥ 12)</li>
                    <li><strong>Agility (AG):</strong> Primary initiative attribute (reaction speed)</li>
                    <li><strong>Intuition (IN):</strong> Adds to initiative if 12+ (danger sense)</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn Order:</strong> Highest to Lowest</li>
                    <li><strong>Ties:</strong> Resolved by higher AG, then higher IN, then simultaneous</li>
                    <li><strong>Surprise:</strong> Surprised creatures cannot act on the first round</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Initiative Examples:</h4>
                <p><strong>Character 1:</strong> AG 10 (+0), IN 8 (+0) → Initiative = d20 + 0</p>
                <p><strong>Character 2:</strong> AG 12 (+1), IN 13 (+1) → Initiative = d20 + 2</p>
                <p><strong>Character 3:</strong> AG 13 (+1), IN 10 (+0) → Initiative = d20 + 1 (IN below 12)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Movement Points (Overworld)</h3>
            <p>While combat movement is abstract (Front/Back rows), traveling the overworld requires Movement Points.
            </p>
            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Movement Mechanics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Daily Pool:</strong> Characters/Parties have a set number of Movement Points per day
                        based on their mode of travel (Foot, Ship, etc.).</li>
                    <li><strong>Terrain Cost:</strong> Difficult terrain (swamps, mountains) costs more points to
                        traverse.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> Pushing beyond your daily limit causes exhaustion.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Armor Class (AC)</h3>
            <p>A character's Armor Class represents how hard it is for enemies to land a solid, damaging blow. It is a
                combination of physical armor, agility, and magical protection.</p>

                    <li><strong>Higher is Better:</strong> Enemies must roll equal to or higher than your AC to hit.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Shields:</strong> Typically add +2 to AC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magic:</strong> Spells like <em>Mage Armor</em> or <em>Shield</em> can temporarily boost
                        AC.</li>

            <h3>Deity</h3>
            <p>A character's deity is very important. Based upon the month the character is born, the deity determines
                the character's general way of life and may offer bonuses to attribute or skill values.</p>
