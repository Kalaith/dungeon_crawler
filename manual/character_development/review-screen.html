            <h1>Review Screen</h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>After you've rounded up your party and want to review one of your characters (just double click on their portrait), you'll notice that they have several new attributes that weren't apparent during character generation. Additionally, when you review your characters, you'll also have new options available to you.</p>

            <p>The character review screen shows you everything you need to know about your character, and also allows for their feeding and care. Nearly every section of the review screen offers some kind of information.</p>

            <h2>The Value Of Statistics</h2>
            <p>When you review your characters, you'll notice that their statistics have two values: a base value and the current value.</p>

            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Value Type</th>
                        <th>Position</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Base Value</td>
                        <td>Right</td>
                        <td>The statistic's normal level. This value changes only when characters gain a level. It serves as a reminder of the actual value's peak level.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Current Value</td>
                        <td>Left</td>
                        <td>The current level of the statistic that changes as characters become hurt, suffer a malady, or are influenced by magic, potions, or herbs.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <div class="info-box">
                <p>As characters travel, the values for certain attributes may change. When a character is hurt by a monster, for instance, the actual value of LP (life points) will decrease. Other times, attributes are affected. Charisma, for example, goes down when characters become intoxicated.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Examining Items</h2>
            <p>To look at an item in your character's possession, click on it followed by the eye icon. You will be told what it is and what condition it is in.</p>

            <h2>Items In The Backpack</h2>
            <p>Every character has a backpack, a place where they can store up to 16 items. By left clicking on an item to select it, it highlights red. Characters can drop it, give it to another player, or use it in some other way.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Backpack Management:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Capacity: 16 items maximum</li>
                    <li>Select items by left clicking (highlights red)</li>
                    <li>Selected items can be dropped, given, or used</li>
                    <li>Items in backpack are not immediately accessible in combat</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Items On The Body - Equipping Characters</h2>
            <p>In addition to their backpacks, characters may carry seven items on their body. These items are considered "equipped" and at the ready. Obviously, a sword in the backpack won't be nearly as useful in combat as a sword in the hand.</p>

            <h3>Equipment Slots</h3>
            <p>Each of the seven carrying slots represents a part of the body:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Head:</strong> Helmets, hats, caps</li>
                <li><strong>Torso:</strong> Armor, shirts, robes</li>
                <li><strong>Foot:</strong> Boots, shoes</li>
                <li><strong>Right Hand:</strong> Primary weapon</li>
                <li><strong>Left Hand:</strong> Shield, secondary weapon, or items for quick use</li>
                <li><strong>Other slots:</strong> Various armor pieces and accessories</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> Items that cover parts of the body work to improve Armor Class (AR). To equip your character, select an item from inventory and drag it to the appropriate body icon. If you try to equip something your character can't wear, the system will let you know.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The Left & Right Hand</h2>
            <p>While most of the body icons are used for armor and clothing, the left and right hand icons have special significance. Only items in those two boxes can be used instantly.</p>

            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Hand</th>
                        <th>Purpose</th>
                        <th>Items</th>
                        <th>Combat Importance</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Right Hand</td>
                        <td>Weapon Hand</td>
                        <td>Primary weapon</td>
                        <td>This weapon will be at the ready should a monster approach. If characters don't have a weapon here and are attacked, they will have to arm themselves in the first round, losing precious time, or fight unarmed.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Left Hand</td>
                        <td>Quick Access</td>
                        <td>Potions, herbs, shields, or missiles</td>
                        <td>Items in the left hand are held ready for use at a moment's notice during combat.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h2>Review Options</h2>
            <p>While reviewing your character, you have numerous options aside from equipping them or investigating their basic statistics. To see the options available to you, click the right mouse button. You'll see a menu box.</p>

            <h3>Available Options</h3>

            <table class="stat-table">

                <p><strong>Spell Casting Safety:</strong> Detonating a fire ball into empty air could prove rather hazardous, not to mention a waste of astral points. Stick to healing or utility spells when using Cast Spell from the review screen.</p>
