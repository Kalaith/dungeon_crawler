        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Characters need certain skills to survive in their sometimes friendly, often times hostile environment.
                Skills are broken down into seven groups which all Archetypes have the ability to develop: Combat, Body,
                Social, Nature, Lore, Craftsmanship, and Intuition.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Skill Range</h3>
                <p>Skills range from <strong>-20 to +18</strong>. Those on the lower end would have trouble with even
                    simple tasks, while those on the high side could perform complex actions with ease.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>How Skills Work</h2>

            <h3>Skill Check Mechanic</h3>
            <p>When your character attempts an action that requires a skill, you make a skill check using the following
                formula:</p>

            <div class="formula">
                <p><strong>Skill Check = d20 + Attribute Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if trained)</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h4>Proficiency Bonus</h4>
            <p>Characters add their proficiency bonus to skills they are trained in based on their class:</p>
            <table class="stat-table">

            <h4>Difficulty Classes (DC)</h4>
            <p>The Game Master (or game system) sets a Difficulty Class for each task. Your skill check must meet or
                exceed the DC to succeed.</p>

            <h4>Advantage from Secondary Attributes</h4>
            <p>Each skill lists a primary attribute and one or more secondary attributes. If your secondary attribute
                modifier is <strong>+2 or higher</strong>, you roll with <strong>Advantage</strong> (roll 2d20, take the
                higher result).</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Example: Acrobatics Check</h4>
                <p><strong>Skill:</strong> Acrobatics (AG primary, CR/ST secondary)</p>
                <p><strong>Character:</strong> AG 12 (+1), CR 13 (+1), ST 10 (+0), Level 3 (Proficiency +2), trained in
                    Acrobatics</p>
                <p><strong>Check:</strong> d20 + 1 (AG) + 2 (proficiency) = d20 + 3</p>
                <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> No (CR and ST modifiers are below +2)</p>
                <p><strong>To succeed at DC 15:</strong> Must roll 12 or higher on d20</p>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Example 2: Same Character at Level 5</h4>
                <p><strong>Character:</strong> AG 14 (+2), CR 15 (+2), ST 12 (+1), Level 5 (Proficiency +3)</p>
                <p><strong>Check:</strong> d20 + 2 (AG) + 3 (proficiency) = d20 + 5</p>
                <p><strong>Advantage:</strong> Yes! (CR +2 grants advantage - roll 2d20, take higher)</p>
                <p><strong>To succeed at DC 15:</strong> Must roll 10 or higher (much easier with advantage)</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Increasing Skill Values</h2>
            <p>In Advanced mode, characters are given a set of statistic values that reflect standard training for their
                Class. You receive remaining attempts (typically 20, varies by Class) to increase skills you
                consider important.</p>

            <h3>To Attempt a Skill Increase:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Move to the skill screen that contains the skill you want to increase</li>
                <li>Open the Skill Increase Menu</li>
                <li>Select a skill group</li>
                <li>Choose a skill to increase - the system rolls a die to determine success or failure</li>
                <li>Repeat until all skill attempts are used</li>

            <h2>Combat Skills</h2>
            <p>Combat skills determine how well a character wields different weapon types in battle.
                These skills provide bonuses to attack rolls. Defense is handled by your Armor Class (AC), not parry
                values.
                On reaching a new level, Combat skills can be raised by 1 point.</p>

                            triggers, and knowing which tools work best for different lock types. Success often means
                            the difference between treasure and empty hands.</td>
