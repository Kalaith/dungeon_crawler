            <h1>Temple System</h1>
        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Like temples throughout the game world, temples offer your party respite from its adventure, a chance to kick back, have a word or two with a deity, and if the stars are right, your characters might even benefit from a miracle.</p>

            <h2>Temple Options</h2>

            <h3>Add Character</h3>
            <p>If you created your own characters, select this option to form your party. You'll see a list of characters eager and ready and may select up to six. You may also use this option to add one or two characters to your party (after removing the same amount of course) at any time during your adventure.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> You may add newly created characters to your party at the starting temple in the main town. At all other temples, you may only add characters who have been let go at that location.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Let Go Character</h3>
            <p>Sometimes characters just don't turn out to be all that you had hoped for. Perhaps your party's Class mix could have been a bit better. If you're so inclined to remove a character from the group, select this option to do so. You'll see a list of your party's members and with just a click you can remove any character from the group.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Let Go Mechanics:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Character is removed from active party</li>
                    <li>Character is stored at this temple location</li>
                    <li>Can be re-added later at the same temple</li>
                    <li>Character retains all equipment and experience</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Erase Character</h3>
            <p>The permanent version of Let Go Character, Erase Character removes the unlucky one from the game's register of characters. Party members may not be erased, however, until they are Let Go from the party. Keep in mind that an erased character is gone for good.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Erase is permanent and irreversible. Make sure you really want to delete a character before using this option.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Load Game</h3>
            <p>Your party has made some poor decisions and you want to reload from an earlier save. It's the perfect time to Load Game. A list of the currently saved games will be shown. Select the proper game, and your affairs will once again be in order.</p>

            <table class="stat-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Load Option</th>
                        <th>Effect</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Select Saved Game</td>
                        <td>Load your previously saved party and progress</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>None</td>
                        <td>Begin with an empty slate for a new party</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Start</td>
                        <td>Use the game's set of pre-rolled characters</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <h3>Save Game</h3>
            <p>After a particularly hectic encounter, or perhaps a good bit of sleuthing, it's a great idea to save your game, and temples are the most rewarding places to save it.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Experience Point Bonus:</h4>
                <p>Parties brave enough to travel from temple to temple between saves receive the full value of their experience points. Parties who save outside of temples lose 50 experience points per save.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When you select Save Game, you will be shown the list of current saves (if you've just begun, you'll see Start, Game 1, and so on). Select any game slot and customize its name if you wish.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Strategy Tip:</strong> Save at temples whenever possible to avoid the 50 EP penalty. Plan your routes to include temple visits after major accomplishments.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>End Game</h3>
            <p>Select this option to end your travels. This option will not save your game. Select Save Game first if you wish to preserve your progress.</p>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Always save before selecting End Game, or you will lose all unsaved progress.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Ask For Miracle</h3>
            <p>It never hurts to hope for a bit of divine assistance. When your party asks for a miracle, two factors come into play:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Worship:</strong> Does any character worship this particular deity? Who?</li>
                <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Has your party paid their due respects to the deity?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If your character is successful, they may receive the benefits of their pious worship (or their generous contributions). Keep in mind though that like here on Earth, miracles are not a common occurrence.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Miracle Factors:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Character must worship the temple's deity</li>
                    <li>Regular donations improve chances</li>
                    <li>Miracles are rare even with good standing</li>
                    <li>Benefits vary based on deity and circumstances</li>
                    <li>Can include healing, attribute bonuses, or other blessings</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Donate</h3>
            <p>It never hurts to butter up your favorite deity, and donating a few silver crowns to their cause is one of the best ways to do it. When you select Donate, you will be asked to enter your tithe in silver crowns, and the money will be removed from your packs.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Donation Benefits:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improves standing with the deity</li>
                    <li>Increases chances of miracles</li>
                    <li>May provide immediate or future benefits</li>
                    <li>Shows piety and devotion</li>
                    <li>Donations are in silver crowns</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Leave Temple</h3>
            <p>When you've finished worship, select Leave Temple to return to the streets of the city.</p>

            <h2>Temple Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Party Management</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starting Temple:</strong> Use the main temple to assemble your initial party</li>
                <li><strong>Party Swapping:</strong> Let go and add characters at temples to experiment with different party compositions</li>
                <li><strong>Character Storage:</strong> Use temples as safe storage locations for backup characters</li>
                <li><strong>Character Limits:</strong> Remember you can only have up to 6 characters in your active party</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Saving Strategy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Save Often:</strong> Visit temples regularly to save without EP penalty</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Saves:</strong> Use different save slots for different strategies or points in the adventure</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-Major Events:</strong> Always save before attempting difficult challenges</li>
                <li><strong>Name Your Saves:</strong> Use descriptive names to track different save points</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Divine Favor</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regular Donations:</strong> Donate consistently to build favor over time</li>
                <li><strong>Matching Deities:</strong> Ensure party members worship the deity of the temple you visit</li>
                <li><strong>Request Miracles:</strong> Don't be afraid to ask, but don't expect them too often</li>
                <li><strong>Build Relationships:</strong> Visit the same temples repeatedly to strengthen bonds</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Temple Locations</h2>
            <p>Temples can be found in most major towns and cities throughout the game world. Each temple is dedicated to a specific deity and offers the same basic services, though the deity-specific options (Ask For Miracle) will vary based on which deity the temple serves.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h4>Finding Temples:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for temple buildings in town maps</li>
                    <li>Ask NPCs for directions</li>
                    <li>Temples are usually in central or prominent locations</li>
                    <li>Each major city typically has at least one temple</li>
                </ul>
