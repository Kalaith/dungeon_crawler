            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>A character's deity is very important. Based upon the month the character is born, the deity determines the character's general way of life and may offer bonuses to attribute or skill values. Throughout this world, temples offer respite for travelers, and occasionally, characters in need may enjoy divine help.</p>

            <h2>Deity Selection</h2>
            <p>Deities are assigned based on the character's birth month. Each deity has different areas of influence and may provide different bonuses or benefits.</p>
