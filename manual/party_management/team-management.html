            <h2>Split Team</h2>
            <p>There are times when adventurers are torn between two or more different quests that call their attention. At other times it may be a member of the party who is unable to travel. Each seems important. Each warrants attention. Not a problem. Split the team.</p>

            <p>The system allows you to separate your party into two or more independent groups, each of which travels as they please. Selecting this option, you will see a list of your current party members. Just select those players who will form the separate team.</p>

            <h3>Split Team Rules</h3>
            <div class="info-box">
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Control Limitation:</strong> You can control only one team at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Visual Indicator:</strong> Active team members' icons will appear as usual. Characters in other teams will have shaded icons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simultaneous Time:</strong> Time passes simultaneously for the separate teams.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reuniting:</strong> You can unite teams using the Unite Team option only when they are both at the same location.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Advantage:</strong> Occasionally, splitting the team will allow the party to travel more quickly and infinitely easier than with a full team.</li>
                    <li><strong>Map Display:</strong> In the automap mode, the team you're not with will appear as a purple arrow.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2>Unite Team</h2>
            <p>It's been a long hard road for both teams, and the reunion is at long last here. When you've split your team, use the Unite Team option to re-group.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>Unite Team Requirements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Both teams must be at the same location</li>
                    <li>The Unite Team icon will be available when reuniting is possible</li>
                    <li>At all other times, it is crossed out</li>
                    <li>Just click to join the two teams together</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Next Team</h2>
            <p>While your party is split, you can easily flip from one party to another. Clicking the Next Team icon, you instantly join the other party. If your party is split into three or more groups, this option scrolls from one to another in the order they were split.</p>
