            <h2>Talking With NPCs</h2>
            <p>The residents possess much information that may be useful to your party. Sometimes they can be persuaded to send a few tidbits your way, that is of course, if you strike the right note with them. Some may prefer flowery small talk while others would rather get to the point.</p>
            <p>When conversing with residents, you will be presented with several possible statements that your party may make. Often, you may progress through several rounds of statements before the two of you reach a mutual accord.</p>

            <h2>Travelling With NPCs</h2>
            <p>Non-player characters may be convinced that joining your party is a good idea in much the same way. Get on their good side, and they'll put their lives at stake for you and your party. Annoy them, and you'll likely find yourself at the end of their blade.</p>

            <h3>NPC Party Members</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you meet an NPC who's inclined to join your party, they will offer their services</li>
                <li>Just like your own characters, you may review the NPC</li>
                <li>Study their skills and swap items if you like</li>
                <li>You may not, however, control the NPCs in combat</li>
                <li>Just as they freely joined your party, NPCs may leave</li>
                <li>You may wake up one morning to discover the NPC has left</li>
            </ul>
