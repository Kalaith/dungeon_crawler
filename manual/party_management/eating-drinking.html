        </header>

        <main>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>After a hard day's travel, your characters are hungry, their throats are parched, and they're all looking forward to a good meal. Managing your party's hunger and thirst is essential for survival.</p>

            <h2>Food: Rations</h2>
            <p>Characters eat "rations," picnic style meals with good helpings from each food group. Nearly every chandler's shop offers rations, and your party may occasionally find several left behind by wandering groups or hunt down dinner in the wild.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>About Rations:</h3>

            </div>

            <h2>Water</h2>
            <p>Along with rations, characters take water to soothe their palates. Carrying their waterskins everywhere, characters may refill their skins at the many streams and rivers that weave through the game world.</p>

            <div class="info-box">
                <h3>About Water:</h3>

                <li><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> The character's hunger or thirst lines, depending on what you fed them, will reflect the satisfaction of these basic needs</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="note">
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> This icon (mouth) is also used should you wish to consume a herb or potion.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Hunger and Thirst Indicators</h2>
            <p>Characters have hunger and thirst lines that show their current satisfaction levels. Monitor these regularly to ensure your party stays healthy and effective.</p>
